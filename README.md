* Supports multiple model comparisons for best performance.

  
# Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps -
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
https://github.com/saishivaniv/Student-Performance-Prediction.git
```

2.  **Install the required packages**:
   
It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`.
    
```bash
# For venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**:
```bash
python app.py
```
