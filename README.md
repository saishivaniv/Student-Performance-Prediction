# Student Performance Prediciton
ðŸ“š Predicting Student's Performance Using Machine Learning Models

This project aims to predict student's w\exam performance based on several input factors like gender, race/ethnicity, parental eductioan level, test preparation course, writing score, reading score. The application utilizes various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions.


# Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- CatBoost
- XGBoost
- HTML
- Jupyter Notebook


# Features
* Predict student performance in exams based on input features.
* User-friendly web interface using Flask.
* Real-time predicitons based on user input.
* Handles data scaling and preprocessing.
* Supports multiple model comparison for best performance.

  
# Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps -
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash 
https://github.com/saishivaniv/Student-Performance-Prediction.git
```

2.  **Install the required packages**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`.
    
    ```bash
    # For venv
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
